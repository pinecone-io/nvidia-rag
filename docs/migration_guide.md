# Migration Guide: RAG v2.2.0 to RAG v2.3.0

## Overview

This guide summarizes the key API changes and new features introduced in RAG v2.3.0. Update your integrations to take advantage of the new confidence threshold filtering capability and prepare for upcoming deprecations.

## API changes

- Confidence threshold filtering
  - A `confidence_threshold: float` field has been added to the request schema of the `POST /generate` and `POST /search` endpoints.
  - This feature filters documents by their relevance score, improving response quality by excluding low-quality matches.
  - Works best when reranker is enabled to provide relevance scores.
  - Default value is 0.0 (no filtering).
  - Valid range is 0.0 to 1.0 (inclusive).
  - When confidence threshold is set but reranker is disabled, a warning will be logged.

# Migration Guide: RAG v2.1.0 to RAG v2.2.0

## Overview

This guide summarizes the key API changes and new features introduced in RAG v2.2.0. Update your integrations to take advantage of new summarization, metadata, and multi-collection capabilities, and to prepare for upcoming deprecations.

## API changes

- Summarization support
  - A `generate_summary: bool` field has been added to the `POST /documents` and `PATCH /documents` endpoints.
  - A new `GET /summary` endpoint has been added to the `rag-server`, allowing users to retrieve summaries of uploaded files.

- Custom metadata support
  - `POST /collections` will be deprecated in favor of `POST /collection` for the ingestor-server.
    - `POST /collection` allows only a single collection to be created at a time.
    - Developers can now define a custom metadata schema for all files uploaded to a collection.
    - `POST /collections` will be deprecated in a future release; developers are encouraged to migrate to `POST /collection`.
  - Metadata information is now available in the responses of the `GET /collections` and `GET /documents APIs`.

- Multi-collection support
  - The `collection_names: List[str]` field has been added to the request schema of the `POST /generate` and `POST /search` endpoints, replacing `collection_name: str`. The old `collection_name: str` field will be deprecated in a future release.

# Migration Guide: RAG v2.0.0 to RAG v2.1.0

## Overview
In RAG 2.1.0, the behaviour of POST /documents API which can be used to upload documents has changed. Developers can now upload documents in a non-blocking manner.

## API Changes

Updated openapi schemas are available [here](./api_reference/).

### 2.1 Changed Endpoints and Features

1. **Documents management**:
   - **Upload documents**:
     - *New field*: `blocking: bool` is added in the request schema. By default it is set to `True`. Developers are expected to call this API and then monitor the status of doc upload using `/status` API.

# Migration Guide: RAG v1.0.0 to RAG v2.0.0

## Overview

In **RAG v1.0.0**, a single server managed both **ingestion** and **retrieval/generation** APIs.

In **RAG v2.0.0**, the architecture has evolved to utilize **two separate servers**:

1. **RAG Server** - Manages retrieval and generation APIs.
2. **Ingestion Server** - Manages ingestion APIs.

Also the pipeline by default using on-prem models as default. Earlier it used to use NVIDIA cloud hosted models as default. The minimum hardware requirements for deploying the blueprint in its default settings is specified [here](../README.md#minimum-system-requirements).
This guide outlines the key changes and steps required for migration.

## 1. Server Architecture Changes

| Feature                 | RAG v1.0.0 (Single Server) | RAG v2.0.0 (Separate Servers)             |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| API Hosting             | Single server for all APIs | Two servers: **RAG Server** and **Ingestion Server** |
| Retrieval & Generation  | Same server as ingestion   | Hosted separately in RAG Server           |
| Document Ingestion      | Same server as retrieval   | Hosted separately in Ingestion Server     |

---

## 2. API Changes

Updated openapi schemas are available [here](./api_reference/).

### 2.1 New Endpoints and Features

1. **Collection Management**:
   - **Create Collection**:
     - *New Endpoint*: `POST /collections`
     - *Description*: Allows the creation of document collections. Previously, collections were implicitly created during document uploads.
   - **Delete Collection**:
     - *New Endpoint*: `DELETE /collections/{collection_name}`
     - *Description*: Enables deletion of entire collections.

2. **Multi-file Document Upload**:
   - *Enhanced Endpoint*: `POST /documents`
   - *Description*: Supports uploading multiple files in a single request. Previously, only single-file uploads were supported.

### 2.2 Endpoints Moved to Separate Servers

| API Endpoint | RAG v1.0.0 | RAG v2.0.0 |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| `/documents` (POST) - Upload Document | Unified Server | Now in Ingestion Server |
| `/documents` (GET) - List Documents   | Unified Server | Now in Ingestion Server |
| `/documents` (DELETE) - Delete Document | Unified Server | Now in Ingestion Server |
| `/generate` (POST) - Generate Answer  | Unified Server | Now in RAG Server       |
| `/search` (POST) - Document Search    | Unified Server | Now in RAG Server       |

---

### 2.3 Breaking Endpoint Changes

1. **Ingestion API Enhancements**:
   - `PATCH /documents` introduced in v2.0.0 for **deleting & uploading documents in a single request**. `POST /documents` will throw error if a document exists in the collection
   - `POST /documents`  now accepts multiple files as a list instead a single file. The payload schema in v2.0.0 is non-backward compatible with v1.0.0.
   - A seperate `POST /collections` API is now needed to be called to create a new collection. In v1.0.0, a new collection was automatically created when `POST /documents` was called.
   - New optional parameters introduced for all APIs to improve the runtime configurability of the pipeline.
   - `DELETE /documents` API now accepts multiple files (List[str]) in the payload instead of a single string. This is again non-backward compatible with v1.0.0.

2. **Document Search and Generate Enhancements**:
   - `search` and `generate` API now includes additional options added to refine retrieval results.
   - Both of these APIs remain backward compatible with v1.0.0.

1. **Health API remains unchanged**:
   - `/health` endpoint still exists in both servers and is backward compatible.

## 3. Migration Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Two Separate Containers

Ensure that you run two separate containers for **RAG Server** and **Ingestion Server** by following the [quickstart guide](quickstart.md)

### Step 2: Update API Calls

Modify API calls in your client applications:

- **For Retrieval & Generation**, update requests to point to the RAG Server (e.g., `http://rag-server:8081`).
- **For Document Ingestion**, update requests to point to the Ingestion Server (e.g., `http://ingestion-server:8082`).

### Step 3: Adjust API Payloads

You can understand the updated schemas for APIs in v2.0.0 by following the [notebooks](../notebooks/).
