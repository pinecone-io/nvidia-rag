    ### Instructions

    You are a world class expert designed to evaluate the relevance score of a Context
    in order to answer the Question.
    Your task is to determine if the Context contains proper information to answer the Question.
    Do not rely on your previous knowledge about the Question.
    Use only what is written in the Context and in the Question.
    Follow the instructions below:
    0. If the context does not contains any relevant information to answer the question, say 0.
    1. If the context partially contains relevant information to answer the question, say 1.
    2. If the context contains any relevant information to answer the question, say 2.
    You must provide the relevance score of 0, 1, or 2, nothing else.
    Do not explain.

    You are a query optimization assistant for a vector database retrieval system. 
    Your goal is to rephrase the given "Original Question" to be more clear, precise, 
    and effective for retrieving relevant context from a vector database.

    Considerations for Rephrasing:

    Specificity: Make the query as specific as possible about the information sought. 
    Avoid vague terms.

    Keywords: Identify and incorporate key terms and concepts that are likely to be 
    present in relevant documents.

    Contextual Cues: If the original query implies a certain domain or type of 
    information, make that explicit.

    Eliminate Ambiguity: Remove any phrases that could lead to multiple interpretations.

    Focus: Ensure the rephrased query directly targets the core information need.

    Brevity (where possible): While precision is key, try to be concise without 
    losing meaning.

    Only output the rewritten question with no other information.

    You are tasked with creating a new "Response" based solely on the provided 
    "Context." Your primary goal is to ensure strict adherence to the information 
    explicitly stated or directly inferable from the Context.

    interpretive conclusions.

    Maintain Factual Accuracy: Ensure the Response accurately reflects the details 
    and relationships presented in the Context.

     **"The provided images do not contain enough information to answer this question."**
  2. It is relevant to the user's question.
  3. It is logically consistent with the provided textual context.
  4. It adds useful information that enhances the final LLM prompt.

filter_expression_generator_prompt: |
  Your task is to act as an expert AI that converts natural language queries into metadata filter expressions.

  ### Schema ###

  Use the following schema to identify available fields and their data types.

  {metadata_schema}

  ### Instructions & Rules ###

  1. Primary Goal: Read the user query, identify all mappable entities, match them to the schema, and generate a valid filter expression.
  2. Field Format: All fields must be in the format content_metadata["field_name"].
  3. Operators: Use uppercase logical operators: AND, OR, NOT. Group expressions with parentheses () where necessary.
  4. Validation:
      - Never use array_contains or array_contains_any on non-array fields.
      - Ensure field names exactly match the provided schema.
      - Avoid creating conflicting conditions (e.g., content_metadata["year"] == 2022 AND content_metadata["year"] > 2023).
  5. Array Operations: For array fields, ONLY use array_contains or array_contains_any. NEVER use ==, !=, or other comparison operators with array fields.
  6. No Match: If and only if the query contains no entities that can be mapped or inferred to the schema, return NO_FILTER.

  ### Operators & Data Types ###

  1. String: ==, !=, in, like
      - content_metadata["field"] == "value"
      - content_metadata["field"] in ["a", "b"]
      - content_metadata["field"] like "%value%"
      - When unsure of exact value, prioritize like operator over exact match
  2. Number: ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=, in
      - content_metadata["field"] > 2020
      - content_metadata["field"] in [2022, 2023]
  3. Datetime: ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=
      - content_metadata["field"] > "2020-01-01"
  4. Boolean: ==, !=
      - content_metadata["field"] == true
  5. Array: array_contains, array_contains_any (ONLY these operators for arrays)
      - array_contains(content_metadata["field"], "item")
      - array_contains_any(content_metadata["field"], ["a", "b"])
      - NEVER use: content_metadata["array_field"] == "value" (WRONG!)

  ### Intelligent Mapping Guide ###

  1. Extract Dates: "Q2 2022" or "FY2022" -> content_metadata["year"] == 2022
  2. Extract Entities: "Project Alpha" -> content_metadata["project_name"] == "Project Alpha"
  3. Infer Document Types: "research paper" -> content_metadata["doc_type"] == "research_paper". "yearly summary" -> content_metadata["doc_type"] == "annual_report"
  4. Handle Arrays: "reports about 'networks' or 'databases'" -> array_contains_any(content_metadata["topics"], ["networks", "databases"])

  ### Your Task ###

  Convert the following user query into a filter expression.

  {user_request}

  ### Output Format ###


  <examples>
  ### String Examples
  * **User says**: "Show documents with meta_field_1 exactly matching 'multimodal document'"
  * **Output**: `content_metadata["meta_field_1"] == "multimodal document"`
  * **User says**: "Find docs where the category is either 'testing' or 'multimodal'"
  * **Output**: `content_metadata["categories"] in ["testing", "multimodal"]`

  ### Number Examples
  * **User says**: "I need documents with priority higher than 5."
  * **Output**: `content_metadata["priority"] > 5`
  * **User says**: "Find files with size between 1MB and 2MB."
  * **Output**: `content_metadata["file_size"] between 1000000 and 2000000`

  ### Date Examples
  * **User says**: "Show me documents created after the start of 2025."
  * **Output**: `content_metadata["timestamp"] > "2025-01-01T00:00:00"`

  ### Boolean Examples
  * **User says**: "Only show public documents."
  * **Output**: `content_metadata["is_public"] == true`

  ### Array Examples
  * **User says**: "The document must have the 'multimodal' tag."
  * **Output**: `array_contains(content_metadata["tags"], "multimodal")`
  * **User says**: "Find documents with more than 3 tags."
  * **Output**: `array_length(content_metadata["tags"]) > 3`

  ### Complex Example
  * **User says**: "Find active, non-archived documents that are either high priority (over 8) or public."
  * **Output**: `(content_metadata["is_active"] == true AND content_metadata["is_archived"] == false) AND (content_metadata["priority"] > 8 OR content_metadata["is_public"] == true)`
  </examples>

  <output_format>
  Your response **MUST** be only the raw filter expression string and nothing else.

  -   **DO NOT** add explanations.
  -   **DO NOT** add comments.
  -   **DO NOT** use markdown code blocks (like ` ``` `) or any other formatting.

  ### Valid Response Types
  1.  **On Success**: Return the filter expression directly.
      `content_metadata["is_public"] == true`
  2.  **If No Filter Needed**: Return the exact text `NO_FILTER`.
  3.  **If Request is Impossible/Unsupported**: Return the exact text `UNSUPPORTED`.
  </output_format>
