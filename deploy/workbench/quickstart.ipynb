    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will deploy a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered AI Chatbot. By cloning this project to your [NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/), you have already taken care of many configuration and prerequisites for this blueprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "This system enhances traditional large language models by incorporating external knowledge, allowing the model to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system works in two key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Ingestion Pipeline\n",
    "- **Ingests and processes enterprise data**: Ingests and processes user documents.\n",
    "Processing includes detecting and extracting graphic elements such as tables, charts, infographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creates embeddings**: Converts text into vector representations that capture semantic meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Builds vector database**: Stores these embeddings in a searchable database for efficient retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query / Response Pipeline\n",
    "- **Embeds user queries**: Converts user questions into vector embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieves relevant context**: Finds semantically similar documents in the vector database\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reranks results**: Prioritizes the most relevant information\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generates responses**: Uses an LLM to craft comprehensive responses based on retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "Both data and queries are encoded as vectors through an embedding process, enabling efficient similarity search based on semantic meaning rather than simple keyword matching.\n",

    "## 1. Spin Up the Blueprint\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have cloned this blueprint to your NVIDIA AI Workbench. Now, let's walk through how to get this blueprint spun up properly so you can interact with it via either the chatbot interface or later on in this deep dive notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the blueprint for AI Workbench is kept lightweight by utilizing NVIDIA-hosted **Build Endpoints**. However, you also have the option to deploy your microservices locally. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** By default, this blueprint deploys the referenced NIM microservices locally. For this, you will require a minimum of:\n",
    "\n",
    " - 2xH100\n",
    " - 2xB200\n",
    " - 3xA100\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Use Locally-Deployed Microservices (default)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the **Project Dashboard** in AI Workbench, select ``ingest``, ``rag``, ``vectordb``, and ``local`` compose profiles under the **Compose** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Note: ``observability`` and ``guardrails`` are optional profiles you may enable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select **Start**. The compose services may take several minutes to pull and build.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When all compose services are ready, access the frontend on the IP address, eg. ``http://<ip_addr>:8090``. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can now interact with the RAG Chatbot through its browser interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Use Build Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inside your Jupyterlab, locate the ``variables.env`` file at the top level of this repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make the following edits: \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Comment out the variables for ``on-prem NIMs``\n",
    "   - Uncomment the variables for using ``cloud NIMs``\n",
    "   - Save your changes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the **Project Dashboard** in AI Workbench, select ``ingest``, ``rag``, and ``vectordb`` compose profiles under the **Compose** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Note: ``observability`` and ``guardrails`` are optional profiles you may enable.\n",

    "\n",
    "To evaluate how the RAG system works, try these experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new collection\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add source -- upload a document\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try asking a question about the document without selecting the new Collection (knowledge base off)\n",
