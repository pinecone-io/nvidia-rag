Use this documentation to learn about the NVIDIA RAG Blueprint.
The target audience for this blueprint is
developers who want a quick start to set up a RAG solution with a path-to-production with the NVIDIA NIM.
For the prerequisites for this blueprint, see [Minimum System Requirements](/docs/support-matrix.md).

## Overview

The NVIDIA RAG blueprint serves as a reference solution for a foundational Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
One of the key use cases in Generative AI is enabling users to ask questions and receive answers based on their enterprise data corpus.
This blueprint demonstrates how to set up a RAG solution that uses NVIDIA NIM and GPU-accelerated components.
By default, this blueprint leverages locally-deployed NVIDIA NIM microservices to meet specific data governance and latency requirements.
However, you can replace these models with your NVIDIA-hosted models available in the [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com).

### Software Components

The following are the default components included in this blueprint:

* NVIDIA NIM Microservices
   * Response Generation (Inference)
      * [NIM of nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_3-nemotron-super-49b-v1)
    * Retriever Models
      * [NIM of nvidia/llama-3_2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2]( https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2)
      * [NIM of nvidia/llama-3_2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2)
      * [NeMo Retriever Page Elements NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemoretriever-page-elements-v2)
      * [NeMo Retriever Table Structure NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemoretriever-table-structure-v1)
      * [NeMo Retriever Graphic Elements NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemoretriever-graphic-elements-v1)
      * [PaddleOCR NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/baidu/paddleocr)

  * Optional NIMs
    * [NeMo Retriever OCR NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemoretriever-ocr)
    * [Llama 3.1 NemoGuard 8B Content Safety NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_1-nemoguard-8b-content-safety)
    * [Llama 3.1 NemoGuard 8B Topic Control NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_1-nemoguard-8b-topic-control)
    * [Llama-3.1 Nemotron-nano-vl-8b-v1 NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-nano-vl-8b-v1)
    * [NeMo Retriever Parse NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemoretriever-parse)

* RAG Orchestrator server - Langchain based
* Pinecone Vector Database - integrated as a service for efficient vector storage and retrieval.
* Ingestion - [Nemo Retriever Extraction](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main) is leveraged for ingestion of files. Nemo Retriever Extraction is a scalable, performance-oriented document content and metadata extraction microservice. Including support for parsing PDFs, Word and PowerPoint documents, it uses specialized NVIDIA NIM microservices to find, contextualize, and extract text, tables, charts and images for use in downstream generative applications.
* File Types: File types supported by Nemo Retriever Extraction are supported by this blueprint. This includes `.pdf`, `.pptx`, `.docx` having images. Image captioning support is turned off by default to improve latency, so questions about images in documents will yield poor accuracy. For the full list of supported file types, see [What is NeMo Retriever Extraction?](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/retriever/extraction/overview/)

We provide Docker Compose scripts that deploy the microservices on a single node.
Alternatively, developers can launch this blueprint directly in an [NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/) developer environment.
When you are ready for a large-scale deployment,
you can use the included Helm charts to deploy the necessary microservices.
You use sample Jupyter notebooks with the JupyterLab service to interact with the code directly.

The Blueprint contains sample data from the [NVIDIA Developer Blog](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/rag/blob/main/data/dataset.zip) and also some [sample multimodal data](./data/multimodal/).
You can build on this blueprint by customizing the RAG application to your specific use case.

We also provide a sample user interface named `rag-playground`.

### Technical Diagram

The image represents the architecture and workflow. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the workflow from end-user perspective:

1. **User Interaction via RAG Playground or APIs**:
   - The user interacts with this blueprint by typing queries into the sample UI microservice named as **RAG Playground**. These queries are sent to the system through the `POST /generate` API exposed by the RAG server microservice. There are separate [notebooks](./notebooks/) available which showcase API usage as well.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - The query enters the **RAG Server**, which is based on LangChain. An optional **Query Rewriter** component may refine or decontextualize the query for better retrieval results at this stage. An optional NeMoGuardrails component can be enabled as well to help filter out queries at input of the pipeline.

3. **Retrieval of Relevant Documents**:
   - The refined query is passed to the **Retriever** module of the **RAG Server microservice**. This component queries the **Pinecone Vector Database**, which stores embeddings of the data, generated using **NeMo Retriever Embedding microservice**. The retriever module identifies the top K most relevant chunks of information related to the query.

4. **Reranking for Precision**:
   - The top K chunks are passed to the optional **NeMo Retriever reranking microservice**. The reranker narrows down the results to the top N most relevant chunks, improving precision.

5. **Response Generation**:
   - The top N chunks are injected in the prompt and sent to the **Response Generation** module, which leverages **NeMo LLM inference Microservice** to generate a natural language response based on the retrieved information. Optionally, a reflection module can be enabled which makes additional LLM calls to improve the response by verifying its groundness based on retrieved context at this stage. NeMo guardrails can also be enabled at this stage to guardrail the output against toxicity.

6. **Delivery of Response**:
   - The generated response is sent back to the **RAG Playground**, where the user can view the answer to their query as well as check the output of the retriever module using the `Citations` option.

7. **Ingestion of Data**:
   - Separately, unstructured data is ingested into the system via the `POST /documents` API using the **Ingestor server microservice**. This data is preprocessed, split into chunks and stored in the **Pinecone Vector Database** using **Nvingest microservice** which is called from the ingestor microservice.

This modular design ensures efficient query processing, accurate retrieval of information, and easy customization.
